# ENHANCED DETECTION OF SUSPICIOUS ONLINE ACTIVITIES USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING

This project introduces a hybrid framework that combines machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to improve the detection of advanced cyber threats.
By leveraging the UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 datasets, the framework achieves high accuracy in identifying and categorizing complex cyber threats, outperforming conventional Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS).

# Main Aim

To provide a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for real-time cybersecurity challenges posed by the increasing sophistication of cyber threats. This project bridges the gap between traditional NIDS and modern detection measures by integrating advanced ML and DL techniques.

# Highlights

Hybrid Framework: Combines ML models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM) with DL architectures (Autoencoders, Multi-Layer Perceptrons) for robust and comprehensive threat detection.
High Accuracy: Achieves up to 100% classification accuracy with DL models on the CICIDS2017 dataset.

Performance Validation: Evaluated using metrics , i.e accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
